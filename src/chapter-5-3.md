In this chapter, we will explore the important topic of knowing when to end a mentorship. While mentorship relationships are valuable and can have a lasting impact on one's career, there comes a time when it is appropriate to conclude the mentoring partnership. This chapter will discuss key considerations and indicators that signify the need to end a mentorship.

**Reflecting on Goals**
-----------------------

At various stages of a mentoring relationship, mentees should reflect on their initial goals and assess whether they have been achieved or if they have evolved over time. If mentees find that their goals have been met, it may be an indication that it is time to consider concluding the mentorship. Conversely, if the mentee's goals have drastically changed, it might be necessary to seek a different mentor who can better support the new objectives.

**Mutual Agreement**
--------------------

A natural and healthy end to a mentorship occurs when both the mentor and mentee mutually agree that they have accomplished the desired outcomes or have reached a point where further guidance is no longer necessary. Open and honest communication between the mentor and mentee is crucial in gauging this mutual agreement. They should have a discussion about the progress made, the mentee's level of self-sufficiency, and any remaining areas that require attention.

**Goal Realignment**
--------------------

Sometimes, during the course of a mentorship, it becomes evident that the mentee's goals and the mentor's expertise are no longer aligned. This could be due to changes in the mentee's career path, interests, or industry. In such cases, it may be beneficial for the mentee to seek a mentor who possesses the relevant experience and knowledge to address their current needs and aspirations.

**Increasing Independence**
---------------------------

One of the primary goals of mentorship is to foster the mentee's growth and development, enabling them to become more independent and self-reliant. As the mentee gains confidence, acquires new skills, and becomes proficient in navigating their career, there may come a point where they no longer require the same level of guidance and support from their mentor. Recognizing and embracing this increased independence could indicate that the mentorship has run its course.

**Time Limitation**
-------------------

In some cases, mentorships have designated timeframes or predetermined end dates. This could be due to organizational policies, program guidelines, or the availability of the mentor. When the agreed-upon duration of the mentorship comes to an end, it provides a natural opportunity for both parties to evaluate the progress made and determine if further mentorship is necessary.

**Outgrowing the Mentorship**
-----------------------------

Mentorships are most effective when there is a good fit between the mentor and mentee. However, as mentees progress in their careers and gain expertise, they may outgrow their mentors, surpassing their mentor's knowledge or experience in certain areas. This can indicate that it is time to seek new mentors who can provide more advanced guidance and help mentees continue their growth trajectory.

**Conclusion**
--------------

While mentorship relationships can be immensely valuable, it is essential to recognize when it is appropriate to conclude the mentorship. Reflecting on goals, mutual agreement, goal realignment, increasing independence, time limitations, and outgrowing the mentorship are all important considerations. By understanding these indicators and having open conversations with their mentors, mentees can gracefully bring their mentorship to a close while being appreciative of the learning and growth achieved during the partnership.
