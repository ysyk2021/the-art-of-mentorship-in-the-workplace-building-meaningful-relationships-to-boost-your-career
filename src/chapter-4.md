Setting clear goals and objectives is essential for ensuring that the mentorship relationship remains focused and productive.

Setting goals and objectives can help keep the mentorship relationship on track and ensure that progress is being made.

Creating a Plan for Success

Finally, mentors and mentees should create a plan for success. This may include identifying specific actions and strategies for achieving goals, outlining potential obstacles and challenges, and developing contingency plans. By creating a plan for success, both parties can stay focused and committed to achieving their desired outcomes.

Conclusion
